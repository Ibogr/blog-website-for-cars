# Car Blog Website

This is a Full-Stack Car Blog Website built with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and EJS templates, featuring a dynamic and responsive interface powered by Bootstrap. The website allows users to browse car blogs, filter by category, and view detailed posts, while giving admins full control over content management.

## Key Features:

__Dynamic Blog Listings:__ Each blog displays a title, brief description, and image in a responsive card layout.

__Category Filtering:__ Users can filter blogs by car type (Sports, Classic, SUV, Saloon).

__Admin Dashboard:__ Allows CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on blogs and categories.

__Reusable EJS Partials:__ Navigation, blog cards, category menu, and pagination keep the code DRY.

__Image Uploads:__ Admins can upload images for blogs, served via a static images folder.

__Homepage Highlights:__ Conditional rendering to feature selected blogs on the homepage.

__Bootstrap-Powered UI:__ Fully responsive, clean, and mobile-friendly design with cards, grids, buttons, and forms.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with full-stack web development, including database integration, dynamic template rendering, server-side routing, and responsive front-end design.
